# MLP-SAE
The R script corr.R is to calculate the R-square between the estimated expression and the true expression of each gene in the samples for both the MLP-SAE model and the MLP-SAE dropout model. 
It includes codes for generating figures 4-6 in the main paper.

The data output\_true.txt is true expression of each gene, output.txt is the estimate of gene expression under MLP-SAE model and output dropout.txt is the estimate of gene expression under MLP-SAE dropout model.
